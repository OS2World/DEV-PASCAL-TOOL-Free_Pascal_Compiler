================
This packages contains the following subdirs:

- text   text mode demos (should run everywhere)
- graph  demos those use the graph unit (runs nearly everywhere)
         includes gameunit (text&graph), outputs to another subdir level
- modex  demos those make extensive use of modeX (runs with go32v2 only)
- win32  demos those are win32 specific
- linux  demos those are linux specific
- os2    demos those are OS/2 specific
- palmos demos those are palmos specific (dragonball)

To build the programs simply type 'make' in the base dir.

If you want to add further samples, edit Makefile.fpc
and rebuild the real Makefile by entering 'fpcmake'.
This is a special fpc generic utility to simplify
platform independent makefile generation for the user.
