The FPC ModeX docs...

--------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTICE:

The ported programs (see below) were found on a site that claims to only have
PD stuff, and the webmaster said that everything he published was sent to
him with that purpose. We tried finding the persons mentioned in the mail
over internet, but that failed.

If there is somebody that claims authorship of these programs, please mail
marco@freepascal.org, and the sources will be removed from our websites.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUEST:

As a developper team, we don't want spend 90% of our time in creating demoes.
If you have something nice, which explains not yet demonstrated features or
technicques, mail contact us via marco@freepascal.org, or add it to the
contrib page.
The readers are also encouraged to explore FPC's excellent documentation
with many examples!!!!!

What are the FPC ModeX programs?

The FPC ModeX programs are a series of simple, small programs written or
ported by Marco van de Voort (marco@freepascal.org) as demos for the
Free Pascal compiler (FPC) and its Run Time Libraries (RTL).
The "ported" programs were first used to test the compability of the GRAPH
unit. Since we had them, and they were very likely PD or GPL, we decided
to use them when we couldn't contact the authors

- Voxel (Marcin Borkowski or Bas van Gaalen, depends on src)
  Displays a landscape in which you can move.

-------------
Voxel, more a demo than a game.

A program I already ported to M2 once. Also from SWAG I believe, but it
has been cycling FIDOnets Pascal areas for years.

The program displays a landscape in which you can move with the cursor keys.
Exit with ESCAPE. A flabbergasting effect in just 150 lines.
