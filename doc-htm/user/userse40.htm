<!--l. 2116--><p class="noindent">The following units are standard and are meant to be ported to all supported platforms by Free
Pascal. A brief description of each unit is also given.
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">This unit is similar to the unit of the same name of Turbo Pascal. It implements writing
     to the console in color, moving the text cursor around and reading from the keyboard.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">This unit provides basic routines for accessing the operating system. This includes file
     searching, environment variables access, getting the operating system version, getting
     and setting the system time. It is to note that some of these routines are duplicated in
     functionality in the <span 
class="cmtt-10">sysutils </span>unit.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">This unit gives you the <span 
class="cmcsc-10"><small 
class="small-caps">G</small><small 
class="small-caps">N</small><small 
class="small-caps">U</small> </span><span 
class="cmtt-10">getopts </span>command-line arguments handling mechanism.
     It also supports long options.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">This unit provides basic graphics handling, with routines to draw lines on the screen,
     display texts etc. It provides the same functions as the Turbo Pascal unit.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">provides basic keyboard handling routines in a platform independent way, and supports
     writing custom drivers.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">This   unit   contains   common   mathematical   routines   (trigonometric   functions,
     logarithms, etc.) as well as more complex ones (summations of arrays, normalization
     functions, etc.).
                                                                            

                                                                            
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">This unit provides support for <span 
class="cmtt-10">mmx </span>extensions in your code.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">provides basic mouse handling routines in a platform independent way, and supports
     writing custom drivers.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">This unit provides the base object for standard Turbo Pascal objects. It also implements
     File and Memory stream objects, as well as sorted and non-sorted collections, and
     string streams.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">is  used  for  Delphi  compatibility;  you  should  never  load  this  unit  explicitly;  it  is
     automatically loaded if you request Delphi mode.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">This unit provides all you need for rudimentary access to the printer using standard
     I/O routines.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">This gives the programmer access to sockets and TCP/IP programming.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">This unit provides basic string handling routines for the <span 
class="cmtt-10">pchar </span>type, comparable to
     similar routines in standard <span 
class="cmtt-10">C </span>libraries.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">This unit is available for all supported platforms, even though the unit name may
     be different (e.g : syslinux, sysos2). It includes among others, basic file I/O routines,
     memory  management  routines,  all  compiler  helper  routines,  and  directory  services
     routines.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">is an alternative implementation of the sysutils unit of Delphi. It includes file I/O
     access routines which takes care of file locking, date and string handling routines, file
     search, date and string conversion routines.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Provides functions to acces Run-Time Type Information, just like Delphi.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">provides basic screen handling in a platform independent way, and supports writing
     custom drivers.</li></ul>
