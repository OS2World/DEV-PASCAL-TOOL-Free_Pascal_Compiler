<H3>What is Free Pascal (FPC)?</H3>
<P>Originally named FPK-Pascal, the Free Pascal compiler is a 32 bit
Turbo Pascal and Delphi compatible Pascal compiler for DOS, Linux,
Win32, OS/2 and (based on an older version) the AmigaOS. More operating
systems (BeOS and FreeBSD/ELF are in advanced stages of development) are
in the works. A beta release for the PalmOS is available as well.</P>
<P>The compiler is written in Pascal and is able to compile its own
sources. The source files are included.</P>
<P> Free Pascal is modest regarding its minimal system requirements
(386-25 Mhz for the Intel version and ideally a 68020 processor for the
Motorola version). At least 2 megabytes of RAM are required. To remake
the compiler more than 16MB is recommended.</P>
<P>Short history:
<UL>
<LI>06/1993: project start</LI>
<LI>10/1993: first little programs work</LI>
<LI>03/1995: the compiler compiles the own sources</LI>
<LI>03/1996: released to the internet</LI>
<LI>07/2000: 1.0 version</LI>
<LI>12/2000: 1.0.4 version </LI>
<LI>4/2002: 1.0.6 version </LI>
<LI>4/2003: 1.0.8 versuin </LI>
</UL>
</P>
<LI><A name=versions></A>
<H3>Which versions exist, and which one should I use?</H3>
<P>FPC's version numbering changed a few times over the years. Versions
before 0.99.5 are considered archaic. After the release of 0.99.5 a
system in version numbering was introduced, and that system was changed
slightly changed after the 1.0 release. </P>
<B>Versioning for versions 0.99.5 - 1.0</B>
<P>Compilers with an <B>even</B> last number are <B>release</B>
versions (e.g. 0.99.8, 0.99.10, 0.99.12, 0.99.14 1.0.0)<BR>Compilers and
packages with an <B>odd</B> last number are <B>development</B> versions
(e.g. 0.99.9, 0.99.11, 0.99.13, 0.99.15) </P>
<P>0.99.5 is an exception to this rule, since <B>0.99.5 IS a release</B>
(a release prior to the introduction of this odd/even system).</P>
<P>Letters behind the version number (0.99.12b, 0.99.5d) indicate
release versions with some bugs and problems in the original release
(respectively 0.99.12 and 0.99.5) fixed.</P>
<P><B>Versioning after 1.0</B></P>
<P>Together with the release of 1.0 the version numbering has been
slightly changed, and a system in versioning resembling the Linux
kernel's has been introduced. The main difference is that the difference
between a release version is now in the second number (1.0.x vs 1.1.x)
instead of the third number (0.99.14 vs 0.99.15), and the third number
now becomes the patch level, replacing the postfixed letter in the old
system. </P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Releases that only fix bugs in version 1.0 will be numbered 1.0.x </LI>
<LI>New development (the so called snapshots) have version number
1.1.x. The meaning of the third version number x in the new
development branch is not defined yet, it could be used for test
releases or to signal major changes. </LI>
<LI>Eventually the 1.1.x versions, when stabilized will be released as
version 1.2. Fixes on the 1.2 release will be numbered 1.2.x </LI>
<LI>The new development after the 1.2 release will be numbered 1.3.x
and so on </LI>
<LI>When really big changes are implemented, the version will be
updated in the major number. This could be case with e.g. a
codegenerator rewrite with support for other processors </LI>
</UL>
<P></P>
<P>Normally you would want to use a release. Releases are considered
stable, and easier to support (the bugs, quirks and unintended
"features" are well known after a period of time, and workarounds
exist). </P>
<P>Development snapshots (which are generated daily) reflect the current
status of the compiler. Development versions probably have new features
and larger bugs fixed since the last release, but might have some
temporary stability drawbacks (which are usually fixed by the next day).</P>
<P>Development snapshots are often quite useful for certain categories of
users. Ask in the maillists if it is worth the trouble in your case if
you're not sure. </P>
<P>We advise all users to upgrade to the newest version for their
target. (1.0.8) </P>

<H3>Free Pascal and GNU Pascal - a comparison</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>Aim:</B>
<DD>Free Pascal tries to implement a Borland compatible pascal
compiler on as many platforms as possible. GNU Pascal tries to
implement a portable pascal compiler based on POSIX.
<DT><B>Version:</B>
<DD>Currently, Free Pascal is at version 1.0.8. GNU Pascal is at
version 2.8.1 (but this numbering is not really an indication, it
follows the GNU C numbering, since it is a derivation of it)
<DT><B>Operating systems:</B>
<DD>Free Pascal runs on a limited number of systems : DOS, Win32,
Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OS/2, BeOS and AmigaOS and is for the moment
limited to the Intel and Motorola architectures. GNU Pascal runs
basically on any system that can run GNU C.
<DT><B>Sources:</B>
<DD>Free Pascal is entirely written in Pascal (about 6 Mb of source
code), while GNU Pascal is written in C (it's an adaptation of the GNU
C compiler: 2.8 Mb code + 8 MB of GNU C code)
<DT><B>Language:</B>
<DD>Free Pascal supports the Borland Pascal dialect Borland, and
implements the Delphi Object Pascal language. GNU Pascal supports ISO
7185, ISO 10206, (most of) Borland Pascal 7.0
<DT><B>Extensions:</B>
<DD>Free Pascal implements method, function and operator overloading.
GNU Pascal implements operator overloading.
<DT><B>License:</B>
<DD>Both compilers come under the GNU GPL.
<DT><B>Author:</B>
<DD>Free Pascal was started by Florian Klaempfl, Germany
(florian&#x040;freepascal.org), GNU Pascal was started by Jukka Virtanen,
Finland (jtv&#x040;hut.fi). </DD></DL><BR>

<H3>License and copyright information</H3>
<P> Applications created by the compiler and using the runtime
library come under a modified library gnu public license (LGPL),
which permit no restriction on the type of license the application
has. It is therefore possible to create closed source
or proprietary software using Free Pascal.
</P>
<P> The compiler source code, on the other hand, comes under
the GNU Public license, which means that any usage of the compiler
source can only be used in software projects which have the same

<H3> Why do i have to supply a user name and password to get Free Pascal ? </H3>
<P> You are trying to login in to an ftp site. You must use the login name:
anonymous and as your password, you should put your e-mail address.
</P>
</LI>
<LI><A name=general-connectftp></A>
<H3>Access denied error when connecting to the Free Pascal FTP site</H3>
<P>The Free Pascal main ftp site can only accept a maximum number of
simultaneous connections. If this error occurs, it is because
this limit has been reached. The solution is either to wait and
retry later, or better still use one of the Free Pascal mirror sites.</P>
</LI>
<LI><A name=ideinst></A>
<H3>Where can I find a text mode IDE?</H3>
<P>The development of the IDE (integrated development environment) is
not yet finished. However a working test version of the IDE is included
with version 1.0.x and higher of the compiler. There might be problems
running the DOS IDE under Windows NT and Windows 2000 (especially
the debugger), in that case it is suggested to use the native Windows
version. </P>
</LI>
<LI><A name=snapshot></A>
<H3>I want a new version NOW</H3>
<P>In the time between the release of new official versions, you can
have a look at and test developer versions (so-called "snapshots"). Be
warned though: this is work under progress, so in addition to old bugs
fixed and new features added, this may also contain new bugs. </P>
<P>Snapshots are generated automatically each night from the current
source at that moment. Sometimes this may fail due to bigger changes not
yet fully implemented. If your version doesn't work, try again one or
two days later. You're advised not to download the GO32v1 version for
Dos, since it's not supported any more. </P>
<P>The latest snapshot can always be downloaded from the <A
development</A>
web page. </P>
</LI>
<LI><A name=installsnap></A>
<H3>Installing a snapshot</H3>
<P>To install a snapshot, extract the zip archive into the existing
program directory of the last official version of Free Pascal (after
making a backup of the original of course). You can also extract it into
an empty directory and then move the files to the program directory,
overwriting existing files. </P>
<P> Make sure that you extract the ZIP archive such that the included
directory structure remains intact. For example if you use PKUNZIP,
use "pkunzip -d" instead of just "pkunzip". Note that snapshots also
contain a new RTL which most likely can't be used with the previous
release version, so backup your old RTL as well. </P>
</LI>
<LI><A name=KnownBugs></A>
<H3>Known bugs / Reporting bugs</H3>
<P>Go to the bugs page</A>. </P>
<P>If you wish to know the bugs for a specific Free Pascal version, go to the bugs
page, display the bug database. At the end of the page you should
see an option to view only specific bugs. Choose "With Version"
with the version you want to get information about and
"With Status" choose "Unfixed". This should display all bugs
which are present in the specific version of the compiler
you requested.
</P>
</LI>
<LI><A name=HOMEWORK></A>
<H3>I have to write a program for homework. Can you help?</H3>
<P>No. Please, don't send us mail about homework, we are no teachers.
The Free Pascal development team tries to give good support for the Free
Pascal compiler and are trying to always reply to emails. If we get
emails like this, this becomes harder and harder. </P>
</LI>
<LI><A name=ErrorPos></A>
<H3>Getting more information when an application crashes</H3>
<OL>
<LI>The easiest possibility is to recompile your program with -gl
debugging option. This way unit LineInfo is automatically linked in,
and the printout after a program crash then contains source line
numbers in addition to addresses of the crash. To see runtime library (RTL)
functions in the backtrace with their real name, you have to recompile
the RTL with -gl too.</LI>
<LI>For more comprehensive checking, compile the
program with debugging information (use the -g command line option) </LI>
<LI>Load the program in the debugger <PRE>gdb(pas)(w) --directory=&lt;src dirs&gt; myprog.exe</PRE>Notes:
<UL>
<LI>Under UNIX systems (Linux, the BSD's), don't add the ".exe" after myprog
<LI>"<TT>src dirs</TT>" is a list of directories containing the
source code files of myprog and the units it uses seperated by
semi-colons (";"). The current directory is automatically included.</LI>
</UL>
<LI>Once inside the debugger, you can (optionally) set the command
line options that will be passed to your program using the command
"<TT>set args &lt;option1 option2 ...&gt;</TT>"
<LI>To start the program, type "<TT>run</TT>" and press enter
<LI>After the program has crashed, the address of the instruction
where the crash occurred will be shown. The debugger will try to
display the source code line corresponding with this address. Note
that this can be inside a procedure of the RTL, so the source may not
always be available and most likely the RTL wasn't compiled with
debugging information.
<LI>If you then type "<TT>bt</TT>" (BackTrace), the addreses in the
call stack will be shown (the addresses of the procedures which were
called before the program got to the current address). You can see
which source code lines these present using the command
<PRE>info line *&lt;address&gt;</PRE>For example:<PRE>info line *0x05bd8</PRE></LI>
</OL>
<LI><A name=general-heap></A>
<H3>Increasing the heap size</H3>
<P>By default Free Pascal allocates a small part of RAM for your
application as heap memory. If it just allocated all it could get,
people running Windows would have problems as Windows would increase
the swap file size to give the program more memory on and on, until
the swap file drive would be full. </P>
<P>You can specify the size of the heap with -Chxxxx. </P>
<P>However, the heap size doesn't really matter, since the Heap
is able to grow: if you've used all the available heap space, the
program will try to get more memory from the Operating system (OS),
so the heap is limited to the maximum amount of free memory provided by
the OS. </P>
<P>It is only handy if you know you will need at least a certain amount
of memory. You can then specify this value using the -Ch parameter, so
your program will allocate it at once on startup. This is slightly
faster than growing the heap a number of times. </P>
</LI>
<LI><A name=general-doesntfindfiles></A>
<H3>Compiler seems to skip files in directories that -Fu points to</H3>
<P>This sometimes happens with installation/compilation scripts if the
copying command doesn't preserve dates. The object files get older than
the PPU file, and the compiler tries to recompile them. A simple <TT>touch</TT>
will solve it. </P>
</LI>
<LI><A name=binariesbig></A>
<H3>Why are the generated binaries so big?</H3>
<P>There are several reasons and remedies for this: </P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
<P>You can create smartlinked applications. To turn on
the generation of smartlinkable units, use the -Cx command
line option when compiling your units. To turn on
the linking of previously generated smarlinkable units, use the -XX
(-XS in 0.99.12 and earlier) command line option when compiling a
program. </P>
<LI>Normally, all symbol information is included in the resulting
program (for easier debugging). You can remove this by using the -Xs
command line option when compiling your program (it won't do anything
when compiling units)
<LI>You can use UPX to pack the .EXEs (just like e.g. pklite) for Dos
(GO32v2) and Windows targets. Look <A
href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">here</A> for
more info.
<LI>You can use LXLITE for packing EMX binaries, but you won't be able
to run them under DOS (with extender) any more then. It might even not
be possible to use them on lower OS/2 versions (like 2.x) depending on
chosen type of compression. LXLITE can be found e.g. on <A
href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/">Hobbes</A>, search for LXLITE.
<LI>Turn on optimalisations, both for supplied packages (RTL, FV, FCL)
and for your own code, this will also decrease the code size. </LI>
</OL>
<P></P>
</LI>
<LI><A name=cfgfiles></A>
<H3>Configuration file problems (fpc.cfg or ppc386.cfg)</H3>
<P> Starting from version 1.0.6 of Free Pascal, the configuration
file is now called <TT>fpc.cfg</TT> instead of <TT>ppc386.cfg</TT>.
For backward compatibility , <TT>ppc386.cfg</TT> is still searched first
and, if found, is used instead of <TT>fpc.cfg</TT></P>
<P> Versions prior to Free Pascal 1.0.6 do not recognize <TT>fpc.cfg</TT>,
so if you wish to use an earlier version of the compiler using the
same configuration file used with FPC version 1.0.6 (or later),
the configuration file should be renamed to <TT>ppc386.cfg</TT></P>.
</LI>
<LI><A name=runerror></A>
<H3>Runtime errors</H3>
<P> When there is abnormal termination of an application generated
by Free Pascal, it is very probable that a runtime error will be
generated. These errors have the form : </P>
<PRE>
Runtime error 201 at 0x00010F86
0x00010F86  main,  line 7 of testr.pas
0x0000206D
</PRE>
<P> The 201 in this case indicates the runtime error
number. The definition of the different runtime error numbers is
described in the Free Pascal user's manual, Appendix D. The
hexadecimal numbers represent the call stack when the error occured.

<H3>Debugging smartlinked code does not fully work</H3>
<P>Debugging smart linked code might not work correctly. This is
due to the fact that no type information is emitted for
smartlinked code. If this would not be done, the files
would become enormous.
</P>
<P> While debugging, it is not recommended to use the
smartlinking option.</P>

Sometimes, even though there is a binary version of a module (unit file and object file)
available, the compiler still gives compilation errors. This can be caused either by an
incompatibility in the PPU file format (which should change only between
major versions of the compiler), or by a change in one of the units of the RTL
which has changed in between releases.
</P>
<P>
To get more information, compile the code using the -va (show all information)
compiler switch, and the unit loading phase will be displayed. You might
discover that the unit being loaded requires to be recompiled because one
of the unit it uses has changed.
</P>
<P>So if you plan on distributing a module without the source code, the binaries
should be compiled and made available for all versions of the compiler you
wish to support, otherwise compilation errors are bound to occur.
</P>
<P>In other words, the unit (PPU) file format does not change significantly
in between minor releases of the compiler (for exemple : from 1.0.4 and 1.0.6)
which means they are binary compatible, but because the interface of the units
of the RTL certainly changes between versions, recompilation will be required
for each version anyways.

<H3>File denied errors when opening files with reset </H3>
<P> Trying to open files using <CODE>reset</CODE> on non-text files
might cause a Runtime Error 5 (Access denied). </P>
<P> All files opened using the above system unit routine use the current
<CODE>filemode</CODE> value to determine how the file is opened. By
default, <CODE>filemode</CODE> is set to 2 (Read/Write access).
</P>
<P>So, a call to <CODE>reset</CODE> on non-text files does <EM>not</EM>
indicate that the file will be opened read-only. So, trying to open a file
using <CODE>reset</CODE> with the defaults will fail on read-only files.
<CODE>filemode</CODE> should be set to 0 (Real-only access) before
calling <CODE>reset</CODE> to solve this problem. A sample solution
is shown below.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>The ppc386.cfg or fpc.cfg isn't in the same path as the compiler
executable (go32v2, win32 and OS/2) or can't be found as
"/etc/fpc.cfg" or ".fpc.cfg" in your homedirectory (Linux).

<H3>Using the graph unit with Free Pascal</H3>
<P>Since version 1.0, we  have a completely platform independent way
of selecting resolutions and bitdepths. You are strongly encouraged to
use it, because other ways will probably fail on one or other platform.
See the documentation of the graph unit for more information. </P>
</LI>
<LI><A name=WrongColors></A>
<H3>Why do I get wrong colors when using the graph unit?</H3>
<P>If you use <TT>detect</TT> as graphdriver, you will end up with the
highest supported bitdepth. Since the graph unit currently only supports
up to 16 bits per pixel modes and since this bitdepth is supported by
all graphics cards made in at least the last 5 years, you will most
likely get a 16 bit mode. </P>
<P>The main problem is that in 16 (and 15, 24, 32, ...) bit modes, the
colors aren't set anymore using an index in a palette (the palettized
way is called "indexed color"). In these modes, the color number itself
determines what color you get on screen and you can't change this color.
The color is encoded as follows (for most graphics cards on PC's at
least): </P>
<UL>
<LI>15 bit color: lower 5 bits are blue intensity, next come 5 bits of
green and then 5 bits of red. The highest bit of the word is ignored.</LI>
<LI>16 bit color: lower 5 bits are blue intensite, next come *6* bits
of green and then 5 bits of red. </LI>
</UL>
<P>This means that either you have to rewrite your program so it can
work with this so-called "direct color" scheme, or that you have to use
<TT>D8BIT</TT> as graphdriver and <TT>DetectMode</TT> as graphmode. This
will ensure that you end up with a 256 (indexed) color mode. If there
are no 256 color modes supported, then graphresult will contain the
value <TT>GrNotDetected</TT> after you called InitGraph and you can
retry with graphdriver <TT>D4BIT</TT>. Make sure you use the constant
names (D8BIT, D4BIT, ...) and not their actual numeric values, because
those values can change with the next release! That is the very reason why
such symbolic constants exist. </P>

<P>The original 1.0.6 installer gave errors under Win95/98/Me in some circumstances.
A new installer (INSTALL.EXE) was included after the 10th July 2002 which fixed
the problem.with version 1.0.6. If you downloaded Free Pascal for Windows before
this date, you should upgrade to the latest version of FreePascal.

<H3> Dynamic libraries </H3>
<P>These operating systems do support shared libraries (also called
dynamic link libraries), Free Pascal currently does not emit position
independant code (PIC), as required for the creation of shared libraries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, even though the linux compiler target permits creating shared
libraries, the usage of that shared library may result in undefined
behavior, especially if accessing global variables in the library. Creation
of shared libraries is not recommended with the current version of the
compiler.
</P>
<P>
Importing code from shared libraries does work as expected though, since
it does not require usage of position independant code.

<H3>INSTALL.EXE of version 1.0.6 or above complains about missing TZ variable under OS/2</H3>
<P>
You are most probably using an older version of OS/2 (like OS/2 Warp 3.0)
and don't have TZ variable in your environment. The easiest solution is to add
"SET TZ=..." (e.g. "SET TZ=CET-1CEST,3,-1,0,7200,10,-1,0,10800,3600" for most
of western and central Europe) line to your CONFIG.SYS, and restart OS/2.
The proper setting for you can be found e.g. using the TZCALC tool from
